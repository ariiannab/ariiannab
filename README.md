Instructions to use the code: 
First, the program will welcome you and ask for a message to be inputted, you can pick anything you would like as long as it is a letter or word.
Next, you will be asked to insert a keyword, this will be used as a reference in the Vigenere Cipher To help encrypt or decrypt the users input.
Once you provide your keyword and press enter, there will be a follow up question asking if you would like to encrypt or decrypt the code.
After your response is provided, the code will provide you with your end result.
It will then ask if you would like to encrypt/decrypt another message and depending on the response. it will either restart the process or exit you out of the program.
If the user inputs anything that isn't a letter or word within the program, an error message will appear, then asking the user to only use the correct material for a proper outcome.
