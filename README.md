### Here is information about my program! ðŸ‘‹

Description: a general description of how my program works. Would it be described as an encryption/decryption program that uses theVigenere Cipher table and  is easy to use.
A list of programming approaches I used consist of input/output, looping, handling errors, using strings and functions.

Instructions to use the code: first, the program will welcome you and ask for a message to be inputted, you can pick anything you would like as long as it is a letter or word.
Next, you will be asked to insert a keyword, this will be used as a reference in the Vigenere Cipher To help encrypt or crypt the users input.
Once you provide your keyword and press enter, there will be a follow up question asking if you would like to encrypt or decrypt the code.
after your response is provided, the code will provide you with your end result.
It will then ask if you would like to encrypt/encrypt another message and depending on the response it won't either restart the process or exit you out of the program.
If the user input, anything that isn't a letter or word within the program, an error message will appear, then, asking the user to only use the correct material for a proper outcome.
